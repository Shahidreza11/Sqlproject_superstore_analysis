# SQL Portfolio Project - Superstore Data Analysis

Project Overview:

This project aims to analyze sales data from a hypothetical superstore using SQL. The primary objective is to clean and transform the raw data to extract meaningful insights and support informed decision-making.

Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Data Source: The project utilizes a dataset containing sales information, including order details, customer demographics, product categories, and sales metrics.

Data Cleaning:

Data Structure: The data is initially stored in two tables: OrdersList and EachOrderBreakdown. An Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram will be created to visualize the relationships between these tables and their attributes.
Data Normalization: The City, State, and Country columns will be split into separate columns for better data organization and analysis.
Data Enrichment: A new Category column will be added based on the first three characters of the ProductName column, classifying products into Technology, Office Supplies, and Furniture categories.
Data Cleaning: Duplicate rows within the EachOrderBreakdown table will be removed to ensure data accuracy. Missing values in the OrderPriority column of the OrdersList table will be replaced with "NA".
Data Analysis and Insights:

Sales Performance: Analyze overall sales trends, top-selling products, and customer segments.
Customer Behavior: Explore customer demographics, purchase patterns, and order frequency.
Product Analysis: Investigate product performance, profitability, and popular categories.
Geographic Analysis: Analyze sales distribution by region, state, and city.
Tools and Technologies:

SQL: The primary tool for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
Database Management System: A database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server) to store and manage the data.
Data Visualization Tools: Tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn) can be used to create visualizations for presenting insights.
Project Deliverables:

Cleaned and Transformed Dataset: The final, processed dataset ready for analysis.
Data Dictionary: Detailed documentation of the data, including column descriptions and data types.
SQL Queries: A collection of SQL queries used for data cleaning and analysis.
Data Analysis Report: A comprehensive report summarizing key findings, visualizations, and actionable insights.
Additional Considerations:

Data Quality: Assess data quality and handle potential inconsistencies or errors.
Data Security: Implement appropriate security measures to protect sensitive data.
Ethical Considerations: Ensure data privacy and avoid biases in analysis.
